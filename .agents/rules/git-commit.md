check which all files are not added or committed,  
i need git add and commit msg for each file.  
in format below, so can easily be copy-pasteable in terminal

```bash
git add filename
git commit -m "type(thing): description"

git add filename2
git commit -m "type(thing): description"
```

also you can club similar files under same git msg by adding multiple files, but make sure commits should be very detailed to avoid multiple files in one commit unless very redundant
